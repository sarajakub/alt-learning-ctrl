# alt-learning-ctrl
my thesis project around alternative game controllers (alt.ctrl) and whether adaptive inputs can boost learning outcomes

teensyjoystick_compmouse file is a joystick input to control a computer instead of a mouse.

nanoeveryrotaryencoder file is a rotary encoder input that currently only detects knob rotation, single clicks, double clicks, and the amount of seconds pressed for long presses. Shall change this one in the future so it will control a computer simulation
